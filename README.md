# About

This plugin is designed to add the MobileCoin Payment Method on WooCommerce-driven e-commerce websites.
If the clients will choose to pay using the MobileCoin Payment Method, they will be redirected to a MobileCoin Self-Hosted Payments Page where they can pay in MOB.
When the payment goes through, the clients will be redirected back to your website's Confirmation Page.
